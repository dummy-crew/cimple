## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, search if an [issue already exists](https://github.com/dummy-crew/cimple/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters.

### Pull Request

When you're done making the changes, open a pull request, often referred to as a PR.

âš  Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
